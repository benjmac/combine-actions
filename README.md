Is meant to create a link between two pieces of state, to clean up the reducer of unnecessary cases.

Of course this isn't for all instances
assumes you will be wanting to add it to the same type of the original
example, messages is an array, a new message will be added to that array

I could have made it to where it would take multiple things to be combined but, I want it to where only two, as you have to create a specific name for your middleware to then be plugged ins

Do lose the ability to go right to the reducer
